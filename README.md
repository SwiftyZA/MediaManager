# MediaManager
A small app to manage your music, class/rate each track and build criteria-based playlists. It also includes an Android app (Xamarin) to control winamp from your phone, providing that its on the same network as the PC running the app.

Note: This app is still far from being completed, check the TODO list for progress. I decided to upload it in its current state since it is already functional and becuase so much time has been invested in it that I felt I needed to secure the source code.

The mobile client was also my first ever mobile application, written in under an hour as a PoC. That being said, I fully expect that there are vastly superior methods to those that I used. I do intent to revisit the code once I have had the time to read up on Android & Xamarin best practices and have gone through some tutorials.

Some technical details:<br/>
C# (WPF \ .Net4.5.2)<br/>
Caliburn Mirco<br/>
Entity Framework 6<br/>
